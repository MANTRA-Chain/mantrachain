# Set concurrency for this workflow to cancel in-progress jobs if retriggered.
# The github.ref is only available when triggered by a PR so fall back to github.run_id for other cases.
# The github.run_id is unique for each run, giving each such invocation it's own unique concurrency group.
# Basically, if you push to a PR branch, jobs that are still running for that PR will be cancelled.
# But jobs started because of a merge to main or a release tag push are not cancelled.
